# MOPLAonCPP
This is a C++ code to implement the Multi-Order Power Law Approach(MOPLA) for modelling multi-scale fabrics in Earth's lithosphere. The approach involves solving general Eshelby inclusion formalism for anisotropic viscous materials along with the homogenization(Jiang 2014). 

The code simulates the deformation of a number of ellipsoidal element in a medium.  

The final state of the system is calculated after a number of deformation steps.

# Experiment

The original goal of this project was to test if a faster version than the available Matlab based package(Qu et al 2016) could be used. However our findings revealed that Matlab along with C, implemented in Qu et al 2016 still provides a faster and easy to use version for the academic community.
