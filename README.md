# MOPLAonCPP
This is a C++ code for the Multi-Order Power Law Approach(MOPLA), which is a statistical model, in the field of structural geology, used for solving Eshelby's inclusion problems. The system considers deformation of a number of ellipsoids in a medium, provide the far field flow stress in the medium. The final state of the system is calculated after a number of deformation steps.
will soon try to write the code on Python.
