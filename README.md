# MOPLAonCPP
This is a C++ code to implement the Multi-Order Power Law Approach(MOPLA) for modelling multi-scale fabrics in Earth's lithosphere. The approach involves solving general Eshelby inclusion formalism for anisotropic viscous materials along with the homogenization(Jiang 2014). 


The goal is to make a quicker version than the current available Matlab based package(Qu et al 2016) as well as provide a more flexible package to be incorporated with other mesh based numerical models.
